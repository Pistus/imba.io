# Imba

## Build Fast, Fast.

Imba is a Web programming language that's fast in two ways: Imba's time-saving syntax with built-in tags and styles results in less typing and switching files so you can build things fast. Imba's groundbreaking memoized DOM is an order of magnitude faster than virtual DOM libraries, so you can build fast things.

In Imba DOM elements _and_ CSS are treated as first-class citizens. DOM elements are compiled to a [memoized DOM](/guides/advanced/performance), which is an [order of magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than today's virtual DOM implementations.
