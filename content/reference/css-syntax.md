# css syntax


```imba
css .btn
    position: relative
    display: block
    background: #b2f5ea
    padding-left: 4px
    padding-right: 4px

css .btn@hover
    background: #81e6d9
```
Styles are declared using the `css` keyword. Besides using indentation instead of `{}`, making `;` optional, and using `@pseudo` instead of `:pseudo` it looks like regular css. Line breaks are also optional. The following few snippets might look messy at first glance, but bear with us.

```imba
css .btn
    display:block background:#b2f5ea padding-left:4px padding-right:4px
css .btn@hover
    background: #81e6d9
```
We firmly believe that less code is better code, so we have strived to make the styling syntax as concise yet readable as possible. There is a case to be made against short variable names in programming, but css properties are never-changing. Imba provides intuitive abbreviations for oft-used css properties, as well as additional properties covering common usecases:
```imba
css .btn
    d:block pl:4px pr:4px bg:#b2f5ea
css .btn@hover
    bg:#81e6d9
```
We also want to make it easy to follow a consistent design system throughout your project while not enforcing a predefined look and feel. Imba provides default (but configurable) colors, fonts, size units and more to help enforce consistency:
```imba
css .btn
    d:block px:1 bg:teal2
css .btn@hover
    bg:teal3
```
Rules can also be written on a single line
```imba
css .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2
css .btn@hover bg:teal3
```

There are also some patterns that come up again and again in css. Changing a few properties on `hover` or other states, or setting certain dimensions for specific screen sizes etc. Imba got you covered with property modifiers that we will get into later. But to round up, the first block of css here would usually be written like this in Imba:
```imba
css .btn d:block px:1 bg:teal2 bg@hover:teal3
```
This conciseness comes especially handy when declaring inline styles, which we will come back to later.

## Nested styles
Styles can also be nested. Everything before the first property on new lines are treated as nested selectors.
```imba
css .card
    display: block
    background: gray1
    .title color:blue6 # matches .card .title
    h2.desc color:gray6 # matches .card h2.title
    # to scope in on current item use &
    &.large padding:16px # matches .card.large
```
